# Hack Integer Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle integer overflow bug in a simple Hack program. The `bar` function, which calls `foo`, can cause an integer overflow if the input value is sufficiently large. This issue might not be immediately apparent due to the simplicity of the code and could lead to unexpected behavior in a real-world application.
